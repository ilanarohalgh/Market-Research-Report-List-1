<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Knee Replacement Implants (Knee prosthesis) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fixed-Bearing Implants</li><li>Mobile-Bearing Implants</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Knee replacement implants, or knee prostheses, are classified into two main types: fixed-bearing and mobile-bearing implants. Fixed-bearing implants have a stable design, where the bearing surface is firmly attached to the tibial component, providing durability and simplicity in surgical procedures. In contrast, mobile-bearing implants allow for the tibial insert to move slightly, which can enhance range of motion and reduce wear over time. Both types aim to relieve pain and restore functionality in patients with knee arthritis or severe injury.</p></p>
