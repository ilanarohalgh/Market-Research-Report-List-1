<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Digital Flat Panel Detectors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Indirect Conversion FPD</li><li>Direct Conversion FPD</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Digital flat panel detectors (FPDs) are critical in medical imaging, with two primary market types: indirect conversion and direct conversion. Indirect conversion FPDs use scintillators to convert X-rays into visible light, which is then captured by a semiconductor layer, offering high sensitivity and image quality. Direct conversion FPDs, on the other hand, directly convert X-rays into electrical signals using specialized materials, providing improved spatial resolution and reduced noise. Both types cater to different imaging needs in radiology and diagnostic applications.</p></p>
